# Machine Learning Regression Project

This repository contains a Machine Learning project focused on solving a regression task of a Car Prices Prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohidabdulrehman/ultimate-car-price-prediction-dataset/data)

## Features
- Multiple regression models implemented and evaluated:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Neighbors Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Hyperparameter tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- Comparison of model performance using metrics like R²-score and MAE
- Implementation of pipelines and transformers for data preprocessing and model training.

## Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- matplotlib

To install all dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
